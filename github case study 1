Development Model:
- GitHub is like a website where people from all over the world work together on computer programs.
- They share their ideas and make programs better by working as a team.

Licensing:
- GitHub is like a library where most programs are free for anyone to use and change.
- The programs have different rules (licenses) that the creators choose.

Mode of Funding:
- GitHub lets people put their projects on the website for free.
- They make money from special features that people or businesses can pay for.
- Microsoft owns GitHub, and that also helps keep it running.

Commercial/Non-Commercial Use:
- Companies and groups use GitHub for their work, some paying for extra features.
- People who aren't making money from their projects, like students or hobbyists, can use GitHub for free.
